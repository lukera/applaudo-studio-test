# applaudo-studio-test

Greetings code reviewer,

From the challange description, I assumed that we need to be able to create a single expense and also recurrent expenses (Weekly/Monthly).

If the expense have the Recurrent Base field filled, then every friday or 15th of the month (Depends on what user choose) will be create another Expense record until the Due Date it's not more equals or greater than today.

The scheulable Apex classes (ExpenseWeeklySchedule/ExpenseMonthlySchedule) are already scheduled to every friday and 15th of the month.

The Dashboard and Report are placed on home page of Applaudo Studios application with the filter to June month.

If you need any information please feel free to contact me on my e-mail lucasmarinsedu@gmail.com or my cellphone +55 43 9 96536330.
